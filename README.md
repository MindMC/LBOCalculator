3.	In the Debt Finance section at dividend payment/acquisitions costs, if there are none, add zeros separated by commas.
Local:
1.	Make sure you have the latest version of Java installed (Java 8)
2.	Open Folders: LBO Project > local > program
3.	Double click on the LBO Calculator jar file.
4.	If your monitor size is smaller than the application, maximize the application and use the scroll wheels in the application.
5.	Go through the program by the tabs on the top (left -> right). If you skip sections, data may not calculate correctly, or the program might crash.
6.	Source code to change the program is in LBO Project > local > src. A source code .java file is included, as well as an LBOApplet project which can be imported into Netbeans IDE.
Website:
Part 1: Adding the applet to the website.
1.	Navigate LBO Project > website > classes. An html file that contains the html code to run the applet is there, as well as the class files required to run the applet. Make sure that the file with the code for the webpage (html or jsp) and the .class files are in the same file directory/folder when you upload it to the website hosting service.
a.	Html code to run the applet: <applet id="Applet" code="NewJApplet.class" width="1692" height="700"></applet>
b.	Jsp code to run the applet: <applet id="Applet" code="NewJApplet.class" width="1692" height="700"/>
2.	Source code to make changes to the program is in LBO Project > website > src. A source code .java file is included, as well as an LBOApplet project which can be imported into Netbeans IDE.
Part 2. Instructions to use the applet on the website.
1.	Make sure you have the latest version of Java installed (Java 8).
2.	Use a browser that supports Java, such as Firefox or Internet Explorer.
3.	Make sure pop-ups, and Java are not disabled in your browser.
4.	Because the application does not contain the necessary signatures and access level attributes, as a temporary solution, you must add the website link for the applet to your Exception Sites List in your Java control panel.
a.	An official tutorial on how to do so https://www.java.com/en/download/faq/exception_sitelist.xml
5.	When you load the webpage, a popup may occur, asking you if you would like to run the Java program. Make sure to press allow.
6.	If your monitor size is smaller than the size of the application, make use of the scroll bars.
