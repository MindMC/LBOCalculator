            <br>Follow all the instructions in the program. Enter initial data left to right by tab sections. Fullscreen (F11) is recommended.
            <br>Allow the program to run if a pop-up occurs. If the program does not display, or nothing happens, make sure you are using a Java supported browser,
            <br>such as Firefox, Internet Explorer or Safari (if set up correctly), and pop-ups are not being blocked. Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge DO NOT support Java.
